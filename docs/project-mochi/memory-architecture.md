Mochi's memory systems are designed to provide a solid foundation for its development and growth, enabling the digital companion to learn, remember, and adapt over time.

## Core Memory Components

### Working Memory

* Manages the current interaction context
* Processes recent experiences
* Tracks active emotional states
* Stores immediate goals and intentions

### Long-term Memory

* Stores core personality traits
* Preserves significant experiences
* Maintains learned behaviors and skills
* Builds a comprehensive knowledge base

### Emotional Memory

* Tracks emotional response patterns
* Creates association networks
* Maps experiences to emotional states
* Enables mood regulation

## Memory Integration

Mochi's memory architecture facilitates the integration of its short-term, long-term, and emotional experiences, allowing the digital companion to:

* Develop a coherent personality based on past interactions
* Adapt its behavior and communication based on learned patterns
* Maintain a nuanced understanding of its relationships and social dynamics
* Continuously refine its skills and knowledge through ongoing learning

## Evolutionary Potential

As Mochi's development progresses, its memory systems will be further enhanced to support increasingly sophisticated cognitive capabilities, including:

* More efficient memory management and information retrieval
* Advanced pattern recognition and contextual understanding
* Improved emotional intelligence and social relationship modeling
* Seamless integration of knowledge, experiences, and skills

The insights gained from Mochi's memory architecture will be instrumental in shaping the future of DigiPet, enabling the creation of digital companions with ever-more robust and adaptive cognitive capabilities.
