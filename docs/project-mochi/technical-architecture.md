* Decision trees for interaction choices
* Reinforcement learning for behavior optimization
* Emotion simulation engine
* Personality matrix development

### Interaction Engine

* Natural language understanding and generation
* Contextual response system
* Emotional state processor
* Behavior pattern recognition
* User interaction analysis

### Learning Framework

* Experience classification system
* Knowledge integration processor
* Behavioral pattern optimization
* Skill development tracking
* Memory consolidation algorithms

### Social Dynamics System

* Multi-user interaction management
* Relationship development framework
* Social behavior modeling
* Community interaction protocols
* Experience sharing mechanisms

## Enhanced Capabilities

Mochi's technical architecture is designed to drive key improvements in the following areas:

### Enhanced Learning Systems

Mochi's learning framework and cognitive architecture will provide a foundation for more sophisticated pattern recognition, contextual understanding, emotional intelligence, skill acquisition, and personality development.

### Advanced Social Capabilities

Mochi's social dynamics system enables complex pet-to-pet interactions, group behavior modeling, collective learning, and nuanced relationship development within the DigiPet community.

### Improved Cognitive Architecture

Mochi's decision-making systems, memory integration, emotional processing, and goal-setting capabilities will be enhanced to enable more advanced autonomous behaviors and adaptive responses.
