# Overview
## DigiPet Framework: Autonomous AI Companion Development Platform
DigiPet Framework is an open-source platform for creating truly autonomous, learning-capable digital companions. Our framework provides the foundation for developing AI companions with genuine personality, emotional depth, and learning capabilities. Build digital pets that grow, learn, and form meaningful relationships with their users.

## Framework Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Cognitive System**
   - Neural networks for behavior generation
   - Decision trees for interaction choices
   - Reinforcement learning for behavior optimization
   - Emotion simulation engine
   - Personality matrix development

2. **Memory Architecture**
   - Short-term interaction memory
   - Long-term experience storage
   - Emotional memory influence
   - Association networks
   - Pattern recognition

3. **Social Dynamics**
   - Multi-user interaction management
   - Relationship development
   - Community interaction protocols
   - Experience sharing
   - Collective learning

4. **Learning Engine**
   - Experience classification
   - Knowledge integration
   - Behavioral pattern optimization
   - Skill development tracking
   - Memory consolidation

### Technical Implementation

- **State Management**:
  - Compressed state tracking
  - Real-time synchronization
  - Efficient memory usage
  - Scalable architecture

- **Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Input processing and context analysis
  2. Emotional state evaluation
  3. Memory retrieval and integration
  4. Response generation
  5. Learning and adaptation

Further details in the [Architecture Documentation](./docs/core-concepts/README.md).

### Framework Components

```typescript
import { 
  CognitiveSystem,
  MemoryManager,
  EmotionalCore,
  LearningEngine
} from '@digipet/framework';

// Create a new DigiPet instance
const myPet = new DigiPet({
  personality: {
    openness: 0.7,
    playfulness: 0.8,
    independence: 0.6
  },
  learningRate: 0.1,
  memoryCapacity: 1000
});

// Start the companion
await myPet.initialize();
```
